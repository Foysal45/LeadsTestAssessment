Architecture
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture pattern. The main components of the MVVM architecture are:

Model: The data model or repository that provides data to the app.
View: The user interface (UI) of the app.
ViewModel: The intermediary between the Model and the View that provides data to the View and handles user interactions.
The app uses the following Android architecture components:

LiveData: An observable data holder that notifies the UI when data changes.
ViewModel: Stores and manages UI-related data, and provides data to the View.

The app uses the following libraries:

Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
Glide: An image loading and caching library.
Koin: A dependency injection library for Android.
Coroutine: A library for asynchronous programming and concurrency.
ImagePicker: A library for selecting images from the camera or gallery.
